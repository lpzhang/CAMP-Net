This repository is the official PyTorch implementation of "CAMP-Net: Consistency-Aware Multi-Prior Network for Accelerated MRI Reconstruction" ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11238), [supp](https://github.com/lpzhang/CAMP-Net/releases), [pretrained models](https://github.com/lpzhang/CAMP-Net/releases), [visual results](https://github.com/lpzhang/CAMP-Net/releases)). CAMP-Net achieves **state-of-the-art performance** in
- [Calgary-Campinas](https://sites.google.com/view/calgary-campinas-dataset/home) Multi-Coil Brain MR Raw Data
- [SKM-TEA](https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/skm-tea) Multi-Coil Knee MR Raw Data
- [fastMRI](https://fastmri.med.nyu.edu/) Multi-Coil Knee MR Raw Data
